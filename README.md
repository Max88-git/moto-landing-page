## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a simple start-up landing page using Bootstrap's grid system and reusable components to build a navigation menu.

### Links

- GitHub URL: [Code](https://github.com/Max88-git/moto-landing-page)
- Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://max88-git.github.io/moto-landing-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 3.3.7
- Grid system

### What I learnt

- How to use Bootstrap to create a landing page.
- Create multiple links with a navigation menu using anchor elements.
- I learnt how to make a hamburger menu to make the site responsive.
- Adding a Bootstrap CDN for CSS, jQuery and JavaScript.
- Adding a background image for the landing page.
- Centre content inside a div for styling and grouping.
- Use background-size: cover to scale the image as large as possible without stretching the image.
- How to add subtle shadows to text and horizontal rule.
- Add Font Awesome icons.
- Make the Bootstrap styled website responsive for mobile.

Here is a code snippet I am proud of:

```css
body {
	background: url(https://i.imgur.com/KwgK8wO.jpg);
	background-size: cover;
	background-position: center;
	font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
	color: white;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Navbar 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar) - This documentation helped me to create a responsive navbar, which is probably the most widely used component in Bootstrap.
- [Bootstrap Grid System 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid) - This documentation was useful for understanding about Bootstraps' responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. And I also learnt about the 4 different layout sizes using class prefixes.
